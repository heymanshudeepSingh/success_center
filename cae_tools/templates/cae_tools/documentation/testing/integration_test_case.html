  <h2>IntegrationTestCase Utility Class</h2>
  <p>
    The Workspace IntegrationTestCase utility class provides an easy way to get a view, and then run various assertions
    against said view's text output.
  </p>
  <p>
    This class is designed to use for a majority of UnitTests. A majority of custom functionality in this class provides
    additional <span class="highlight code">assert()</span> statements, on top of what already comes in the standard
    default Django TestCase class.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This utility class has all the functionality provided in the BaseTestCase utility class, as well as:

    <h3>Response Assertion Functions</h3>
    <div class="alert info">
      <p>Note: These will automatically call the below functions in the "Utility Assertions" section. So if you use any
        of these response assertions, then calling the utility assertions is redundant and unnecessary.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Assert Response</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function takes in a few parameters and attempts to
      create a corresponding Django Response page object for the provided URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function then tests for some common values on the acquired Django Response page object, such as verifying
      url, page Title, and checking if the page had redirected or not during request processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For full list of everything this can check, see below "Utility Assertions" section.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert GET Response</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertGetResponse()</span> function is effectively a wrapper for the above
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function. It handles the same, except that it will
      handle some args for you, to set for a GET response.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert POST Response</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPostResponse()</span> function is effectively a wrapper for the above
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function. It handles the same, except that it will
      handle some args for you, to set for a POST response.
    </p>
    <p>
      To pass POST data, set the <span class="highlight code">data</span> arg to a dictionary with values of your
      choice.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert Whitelist User Access</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertWhitelistUserAccess()</span> function is effectively a wrapper-loop
      for above "Assert Response" function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This takes in either one (login) User model, or a list of (login) User models. Can be in format of literal model,
      or strings of desired model usernames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming valid user values are passed in, then this function checks each provided user, and verifies that they
      are able to access the page with no errors. Aka, the page DOES NOT show a 403 error, 404 error, login redirect,
      or some other error.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is very useful for using minimal code to check that multiple different user types can all access a given
      page, and that all their user permissions are allowing access as tended.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert Blacklist User Access</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertBlacklistUserAccess()</span> function is similar to the above
      "Assert Whitelist User Access" function, except it checks for the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aka, for each passed in (login) User model value, it verifies that they CANNOT see the page. Either due to a 403
      error, 404 error, or login redirect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any other page error is treated as a literal error, and will also cause this assertion to fail.
    </p>

    <h3>Utility Assertions</h3>
    <h4>Assert Url Equal</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertURLEqual()</span> function takes in two URLs and compares them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One url should be the "expected url", written as a string, and the other should be a literal url from a Django
      response object, after doing a page query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: This function compares the two urls to assert they match. This includes url parameters, if it's a GET
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ignore url parameter ordering, but otherwise still verify that urls and associated parameters match, set the
      <span class="highlight code">parse_qs</span> arg to True. This is set to False by default, because it's
      technically a more expensive operation, and a majority of site urls do not use GET url parameters.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert Page Messages</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageMessages()</span> function verifies that the expected
      response-messages actually show up in the template response data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: This function does not care when messages are in response that we DO NOT check for. It only cares if we
      pass a message value into this assertion, and no corresponding value is found in the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ease of use, this allows partial message matching by default, as opposed to failing if there is not an exact,
      full match.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert Page Content</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageContent()</span> function is similar to the built-in Django
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertContains()</span> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main difference is that Django templating may (and often does) create large amounts of whitespace, often in
      places that we programmers wouldn't expect it. The default Django
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertContains()</span> function does not account for this whitespace, and will
      fail if whitespace doesn't match exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To account for that, we have this custom <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageContent()</span> function,
      which uses regex to condense whitespace down, or even outright remove it, in instances where the whitespace makes
      no sense. It also simplifies/escapes certain common characters/sequences, to be more uniformly handled, and thus
      easier to test against.
    </p>
    <p>
      This custom function then further uses regex to actually check this updated page content against the expected
      value. The regex is such that the assertion will pass if whitespace does not exactly match, as long as both the
      original page output and expected value agree on where the whitespace should exist.
    </p>

    <h4>Assert Page Title</h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPage()</span> function uses similar logic as the above
      "Assert Page Content" function, but for the page title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reminder that the page title is the value found at the top of the browser tab when the corresponding page is open.
