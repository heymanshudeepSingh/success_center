  <h2>IntegrationTestCase Utility Class</h2>
  <p>
    The Workspace IntegrationTestCase utility class is designed to use for a majority of UnitTests. A majority of custom
    functionality in this class provides additional <span class="highlight code">assert()</span> statements, on top of
    what already comes in the standard default Django TestCase class.
  </p>
  <p>
    This utility class has all the functionality provided in the BaseTestCase utility class, as well as:

    <h3>Assert Url Equal</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertURLEqual()</span> function takes in two URLs and compares them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One url should be the "expected url", written as a string, and the other should be a literal url from a Django
      response object, after doing a page query.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function compares the two, urls to assert they match. This includes url parameters, if it's a GET request.
      Set the <span class="highlight code">parse_qs</span> arg to True in order to ignore parameter ordering, but
      otherwise still verify that urls and associated parameters match.
    </p>

    <h3>Assert Response</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function takes in a few parameters and attempts to
      create a corresponding Django Response page object.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function then tests for some common values on the acquired Django Response page object, such as verifying
      url, page Title, and checking if the page had redirected or not during request processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: This will automatically call the above <span class="highlight code">self.assertURLEqual()</span> function,
      so calling it again to verify the page url is unnecessary.

    <h3>Assert GET Response</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertGetResponse()</span> function is effectively a wrapper for the above
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function. It handles the same, except that it will
      handle some args for you, to set for a GET response.
    </p>

  <article class="color">
    <h3>Assert POST Response</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPostResponse()</span> function is effectively a wrapper for the above
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertResponse()</span> function. It handles the same, except that it will
      handle some args for you, to set for a POST response.
