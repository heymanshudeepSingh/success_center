        When writing Selenium tests, reminder to please add <span class="highlight code">@tag('functional')</span> above
        any and all functions that generate a Selenium driver instance. Tag can be imported from from
        <span class="highlight code">django.test import tag</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows programmers to disable running Selenium tests with the

  <h2>LiveServerTestCase Utility Class</h2>
  <p>
    The Workspace LiveServerTestCase utility class is designed to use for specifically in Selenium tests. Aka, it's
    meant for use when running tests that require a live mock-browser instance. A majority of custom functionality this
    class provides is specifically to make use of Selenium easier and more streamlined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reminder that Selenium tests tend to be a lot more expensive to run, as they take longer than all other test types.
    So they should only be used sparingly when needed, such as to verify Session data logic, Javascript/React logic,
    Django Channels logic, or similar logic that's impossible to verify without a browser instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    This utility class has all the functionality provided in the BaseTestCase utility class, as well as:

    <h3>Login</h3>
    <p>
      The <span class="highlight code">self._login()</span> function attempts to run Django authentication to log in
      with the corresponding username and password. Then does some basic checks to verify that the login occurred
      successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, it's a easy helper function to quickly log in with a given User.
    </p>
    <p>
      If provided, it also verifies that login action redirected to a specific page, calling
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageTitle()</span> and
      <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageHeader()</span>.

    <h3>Selenium Driver/Window Management</h3>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Create Driver</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.create_driver()</span> function will generate and return a new Selenium
        window (aka "driver") instance, with the browser of choice specified in the local env.py file.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Close Driver</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.close_driver()</span> function will close and destroy the passed Selenium
        window (aka "driver") instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This should be called as soon as any driver windows are no longer used in a given Selenium test, in order to
        minimize computer resources used by Selenium tests, and to help speed up how long Selenium tests take to run.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Open New Window</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._open_new_window()</span> function opens a new browser window, associated
        with a given Selenium browser instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not sure if this is better or worse than just creating a new selenium driver instance. This may be more resource
        efficient. TODO: Research further.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Close All New Windows</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._close_all_new_windows()</span> function will close all browser windows
        associated with a given Selenium browser instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chances are, the <span class="highlight code">self.close_driver()</span> function may be generally more
        applicable than this function. But still provided just in case.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Switch to Window</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._switch_to_window()</span> function will switch the selected browser
        window associated with the current Selenium browser instance.
      </p>
    </article>

    <h3>Assertions</h3>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Assert Page Title</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageTitle()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance, and
        asserts that the corresponding window has the provided Title value. Note that title is case sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reminder that the "title" of a page is the value that shows at the top of the browser, when you have multiple
        browser tabs open.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Assert Page Header</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageHeader()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance,
        and asserts that the corresponding window has the provided H1 Header value. Note that Header is case sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reminder that any given page should only have one single H1 Header element, and is usually displayed at the top
        of the page, to indicate what the page is for.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Assert Page Contains</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageContains()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance,
        and asserts that the corresponding window contains the provided text value somewhere in the page.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Assert Page Not Contains</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self.assertPageNotContains()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver
        instance, and asserts that the provided text value IS NOT found anywhere in the corresponding window page.
      </p>
    </article>
  </article>

  <article class="color">
    <h3>Driver Wait Functions</h3>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Wait for Page Load</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._wait_for_page_load()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance,
        and forces a wait for a new page instance to load.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be useful to call immediately after using a Selenium driver instance to click a page link. That way, the
        next page should be loaded before any further Selenium logic occurs.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Wait for ID</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._wait_for_id()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance, and
        forces a wait for an element with the provided ID to exist on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be useful such as when dealing with JavaScript that changes/creates page elements.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Wait for CSS</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._wait_for_css()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance, and
        forces a wait for an element with the provided CSS to exist on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be useful such as when dealing with JavaScript that changes/creates page elements.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Wait for xPath</h4>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight code">self._wait_for_xpath()</span> function takes in a Selenium driver instance, and
        forces a wait for an element with the provided xPath value to exist on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that xPath is a Selenium syntax to try to grab elements. It can be used for checking elements that may not
        have a unique ID or CSS value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can be useful such as when dealing with JavaScript that changes/creates page elements.
