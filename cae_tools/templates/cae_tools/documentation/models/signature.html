  <h2>Handling Signature Forms & Signature Models</h2>

  <p>
    CAE Workspace provides a generic implementation of signature handling, for such as when a user uses a tablet or
    touch pad to physically write their signature.
  </p>
  <p>
    When logic supports it, we recommend not storing the signature to the database (for security). And instead, simply
    using the generic SignatureWidget form field (from <span class="code">cae_home/forms.py</span>) to get a signature
    and then process it directly in the view, without saving it long-term.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this is not necessarily universally applicable and some logic requires saving long-term, in which case
    you should inherit signature logic from <span class="code">cae_tools/models.py</span>. Example below.
  </p>
