  <h1>Documentation - Custom Workspace "CSS" Logic</h1>

  <p>
    CAE Workspace uses entirely custom CSS. This CSS is written in the preprocessor language Sass, and was made in hopes
    of being as reusable/general as possible. The goal to have minimal CSS in future projects, and to have a majority of
    CSS located in one place, in the Workspace project, styled to the CAE Center's needs.
