  <h2>General CSS Logic</h2>

  <article class="color">
    <h3>Compiling CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Since the CAE Workspace CSS is written in Sass, it needs to be compiled on initial project download, and then
      again every time changes are made. See
      <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation_general_setup' %}">Custom Scripts</a> for more information.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="color">
    <h3>Sass Files</h3>
    <p>
      A majority of CSS for all projects is located in Sass files, found at
      <span class="highlight primary">&lt;project_root&gt;/cae_home/static/cae_home/css/sass/</span>. Within this
      folder, any files names NOT prefixed with an underscore are considered to be "entrypoint files", and will be read
      in by the Sass compiler script.
    </p>
    <p>
      For organization, Sass logic is then divided into separate files, based on the general purpose of the styling. Due
      to size of the <span class="highlight">content</span> stylings, these are then further subdivided within their own
      folder.
    </p>

    <article class="color">
      <h4>Project Sass Variables</h4>
      <p>
        Any variables or "universal" logic are found within the <span class="highlight">variables</span> folder.
        Anything here is likely used across multiple other Sass files, if not imported into nearly every Sass file found
        within Workspace.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_core.scss</span> file merges all other CSS files in the
        <span class="highlight">variables</span> folder, as well as contains some functions to make it easier to access
        various color theme style values (because Sass syntax for accessing these is really gross).
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_colors.scss</span> file contains various color definitions that may or may
        not be helpful for later reference. Includes things such as "Officially approved WMU colors as of 2018", "colors
        taken directly from wmich.edu as of 2018", etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_element_groups.scss</span> file contains various definitions of groupings.
        These are used for looping through elements in other files, to ensure consistency across CSS. Whenever looping
        through values in Sass, ideally the loop grouping should be defined in this file.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_font_sizing.scss</span> file contains various sizing definitions for site
        font options.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_mixins.scss</span> file contains SASS mixin functions to expand certain CSS
        values for backwards-browser compatibility. For example, instead of the standard
        <span class="highlight code">display: flex-box;</span>, one should use
        <span class="highlight code">@include display-flex;</span> to call this file's backwards-compatible flex-box
        styles. This is particularly important since the CAE Center serves various sites for WMU, which means we may
        have to support really old machines that use way outdated browsers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight primary">_screen_sizing.scss</span> file contains various sizing definitions for site
        "responsive CSS" stylings (aka, adjusting dynamically based on browser screen size).
