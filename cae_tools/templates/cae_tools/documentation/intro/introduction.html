  <h2>Introduction to the "CAE Workspace"</h2>

  <h3>Preface</h3>
  <p>
    The CAE Center is responsible for managing multiple, unrelated workflows and projects for Western Michigan
    University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, this was done in the form of multiple websites. Each one had their own HTML, CSS, models, logins,
    authentication, templating, etc. However, as responsibilities gradually increased, CAE Programmers found themselves
    spending a large amount of time having to effectively rewrite the same code for more and more individual websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, the CAE Center decided to consolidate everything, so that only one set of "basic templating" needed
    to be maintained for CSS, models, authentication, etc. Hence, the CAE Workspace was born.
  </p>

  <h3>Purpose of the "Workspace" Project</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of "CAE Workspace" is to effectively take care of all possible "universal logic", in one single location.
  </p>
  <p>
    This includes anything that is not unique to any single project maintained by the CAE Center. Such as HTML and CSS,
    login handling and user authentication, general WMU models such as "Majors" and "Departments", etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    As result, Workspace itself doesn't exactly...do a whole lot, on its own. But it provides many, many hooks and
    generalized logic, in hopes of making it simpler to develop various "subprojects". These "subproject" will also be
    more uniform and consistent in how they handle.
  </p>
  <p>
