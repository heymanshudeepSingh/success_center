  <h3>First Steps</h3>
  <p>
    This page lists the general recommended "first steps" in order to start using the CAE Workspace project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started, you should, in order:
  </p>
  <article>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Read the
          <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation' %}">CAE Workspace Introduction documentation</a>. Specifically, just
          the points under the "introduction" section. This will give you an idea of what CAE Workspace even is, and why
          we're using it. It will also give you a starting point to proceed with your own projects.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Run the <span class="highlight primary">installation script</span> as noted in the
          <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation_intro_helper_scripts' %}">helper scripts documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This script will run all the basic setup steps for your project. Presumably if you're reading this, then you
          already ran this script. If not, then your system might not be 100% set up to run CAE Workspace, and you might
          want to go run the script now.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Follow the <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation_intro_setup' %}">subproject setup</a> documentation, to
          either create a new subproject, or clone an existing one down. Subprojects are where a majority of useful work
          is done.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Depending on what you want to work on, read the corresponding section of
          <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation' %}">CAE Workspace documentation</a>, which attempts to document all
          logic that is unique to CAE Workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that doesn't seem helpful, also try our
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZXxataXewDifJfUas_j7eZcklmpSrPt-?usp=sharing">GoogleDocs powerpoints</a>,
          which attempts to show step-by-step, beginner-friendly explanations of full stack development for a standard
          Django project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, feel free to reference the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/">Official DjangoDocs</a>,
          which are maintained by the Django developers themselves. They cover just about anything you could ever want
          to know. But be warned that they sometimes can be very verbose, which can be intimidating to those unfamiliar
          with the Django framework.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
