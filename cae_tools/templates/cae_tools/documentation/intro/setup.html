  <h3>Setting up the "CAE Workspace"</h3>
  <p>
    As mentioned, the CAE Workspace project doesn't necessarily do a whole lot by itself. Instead, it's explicitly
    designed to let other projects hook into it, often referred to as "subprojects".
  </p>
  <p>
    These "subprojects" are Django projects housed within completely separate git repositories. They are put in the
    <span class="highlight code">&#60;workspace_root&#62;/apps/</span> folder.
  </p>

  <h3>Example Subproject Setup</h3>
  <article class="color">
    <p>
      Let's say, for example, we're creating a new subproject to hook into CAE Workspace. This new theoretical
      subproject is called <span class="highlight primary">WMU_Web</span>.
    </p>

    <h4>Creating WMU_Web</h4>
    <p>
      To get started, we need to create our subproject.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAE Workspace has a mostly-automated means of hooking into subprojects. However, one requirement is that each
      found subproject has an app of the same name, plus "_core" appended to it. So in the case of our hypothetical
      <span class="highlight primary">WMU_Web</span> subproject, we'd want a directory structure of
      <span class="highlight code">&#60;workspace_root&#62;/apps/WMU_Web/wmu_web_core/</span>, where WMU_Web is our
      subproject, and wmu_web_core is a Django app within our WMU_Web subproject.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in this case, we use the
      <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation_intro_managepy' %}">Workspace manage.py</a> to run
      <span class="highlight code">python manage.py startapp wmu_web_core</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then create a new folder called "WMU_Web" in our project apps/ folder. And then move the new wmu_web_core
      folder, such that we have the directory structure of
      <span class="highlight code">&#60;workspace_root&#62;/apps/WMU_Web/wmu_web_core/</span>.
    </p>

    <h4>Updating "Allowed Apps"</h4>
    <p>
      There's one more step that needs to be taken before Workspace will recognize this new subproject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open up <span class="highlight code">&#60;workspace_root&#62;/workspace/settings/allowed_apps.py</span>. Near the
      top of this file should be an <span class="highlight primary">ALLOWED_CAE_PROJECTS</span> dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the provided examples, we'll want to add a new entry for the WMU_Web subproject we just created. If it's
      done correctly, then running <span class="highlight code">python manage.py runserver</span> should now display
      output about our new subproject.
    </p>
