  <h2>Custom LDAP Utility Connectors</h2>
  <p>
    Two LDAP utility connector functions are provided at
    <span class="highlight primary">&lt;project_root&gt;/cae_home/utils.py</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are to be used when trying to get a user model via either BroncoNet or Winno. The intent is to make it easier
    to manage model data that may require LDAP connections.
  </p>

  <br>

    <h3>Function Input/Output</h3>
    <p>
      Both these functions take in a single argument, of either "BroncoNet" or "Winno". They both then handle all the
      corresponding LDAP logic (including LDAP not being setup on the local machine) and return values based on one of the
      four following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a user model for the corresponding BroncoNet/Winno already exists in the Django database, then the functions
          will return the found Django model. No LDAP functionality is called.
        </p>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If LDAP connections are setup locally, and valid student data returns for the BroncoNet/Winno, then an
          equivalent Django model should populate from the data. The functions then return this model.
        </p>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If LDAP connections are setup locally, but no valid student data returns for the BroncoNet/Winno value, then the
          functions return None.
        </p>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the user's machine does not have LDAP connections setup (or not properly setup), then it should gracefully
          return a TemplateResponse object.
        </p>
        <p>
          If called from a view, then the view can either display this TemplateResponse object right then, or you can use
          an if statemnt to check for a TemplateResponse object and handle how you like.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are examples of this handling in cae_home/views/misc_views.py.
        </p>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <br>

  <p>
    It's worth noting that "missing LDAP packages", "missing SimpleLdapLib submodule", and "bad LDAP credentials" will
    all result in the fourth scenario. It hasn't been tested yet, but "no internet connection" likely would as well.
  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
    Between all of these, it should be able to handle for both development and production, including users that have
    LDAP connections setup for their machine and users that don't want to touch LDAP at all.
