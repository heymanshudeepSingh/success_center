  <h2>Custom LDAP Utility Connectors</h2>
  <p>
    Two LDAP utility connector functions are provided at
    <span class="highlight primary">&lt;project_root&gt;/cae_home/utils.py</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are to be used when trying to get a user model via either BroncoNet or Winno. The intent is to make it easier
    to manage model data that may require LDAP connections.
  </p>

    <h3>Utility Function Differences</h3>
    <p>
      Both these functions are meant to manage User models in our local Django database. However, they have some
      key differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight primary">get_or_create_login_user_model()</span> - Meant to get/update data for a user
          to be able to log into our project sites. This includes generating both the
          <span class="highlight primary">(Login)User model</span> and the
          <span class="highlight primary">WmuUser model</span>, if either one is not present in our local Django
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, this should be called to make a new CAE Center user, or make a new Grad Apps Committee Member, or
          some other user that needs to be able to log in and physically interact with the site.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight primary">get_or_create_wmu_user_model()</span> - Meant to get/update data for a user
          (often a student) to be referenced in our project logic. But we don't necessarily want/need the user to be
          able to log in. This will only generate the corresponding
          <span class="highlight primary">WmuUser model</span>, if not present in our local Django database.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, this should be called when recording that a student checked out a CAE Center computer room, or
          when recording that a student used a SuccessCtr tutoring center, or some other logic where we need to
          reference the student, but not necessarily let them log in.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Function Input/Output</h3>
    <p>
      Both these functions take in a single argument, of either "BroncoNet" or "Winno". They both then handle all the
      corresponding LDAP logic (including LDAP connections not being setup on the local machine) and then return a
      value based on one of the four following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight success">Success, User already in Django database</span> - If a user model for the
          corresponding BroncoNet/Winno already exists in the Django database, then the functions will return the found
          Django model. No LDAP functionality is called.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight info">Success, User not in Django database, but found in LDAP search</span> - If LDAP
          connections are setup locally, and a valid BroncoNet/Winno is provided, then an
          equivalent Django model should populate from the pulled LDAP data. The functions then return the newly created
          Django User model (either (Login)User or WmuUser, depending on which function was called).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight error">Failure, Invalid user credentials</span> - If LDAP connections are setup
          locally, but no valid LDAP student data returns for the BroncoNet/Winno , then no Django data is
          created/updated. The functions return None.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight error">Failure, User not in Django database, and no local LDAP connection setup</span>
          - If the local machine does not have LDAP connections setup (or not properly setup), then it should gracefully
          return a TemplateResponse object.
        </p>
        <p>
          If called from a view, then the view can either display this TemplateResponse object right then, or you can
          use an if statement to check for a TemplateResponse object and handle as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are examples of this handling in cae_home/views/misc_views.py.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's worth noting that "missing LDAP packages", "missing SimpleLdapLib submodule", and "bad LDAP credentials" will
      all result in the fourth scenario (aka, invalid/missing LDAP connection). It hasn't been tested yet, but
      "no internet connection" likely would also fall under this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between all of these, it should be able to handle for both development and production, including users that have
      LDAP connections setup for their machine and users that don't want to touch LDAP at all.
    </p>
