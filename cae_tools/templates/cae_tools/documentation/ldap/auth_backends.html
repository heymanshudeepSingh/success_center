  <h2>Custom Auth Backends</h2>
  <p>
    Ugh. There's so much to this, and not gonna lie, I (Brandon) haven't touched most of it in actual years. I'll record
    what I do remember, but someone should probably go line by line and re-figure out exactly what this does. I wish I
    had time to document it back when I wrote it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "Auth Backends" are some of the most complicated individual parts of all of our Django projects, due to having
    to interface with main campus. So there's a lot to it.
  </p>

  <article class="color">
    <h3>TLDR Description</h3>
    <p>There are three total "Custom Auth Backends" provided:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>CAE Backend</p></li>
      <li><p>WMU Backend</p></li>
      <li><p>ADV Backend</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these are located in the folder
      <span class="code">&lt;project_root&gt;/workspace/ldap_backends/wmu_auth/</span>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      All three of these are used, and important in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="code">CAE Backend</span> is used for interfacing with CAE Center internal credentials. These
      are maintained separately to main campus credentials, and pretty much exclusively used for internal CAE Center
      logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="code">WMU Backend</span> is used for main connection and authentication with main campus. This
      is the primary means used to sync data between our Django projects and what main campus maintains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="code">ADV Backend</span> is used for pulling auxiliary data we need from main campus, such as
      which students are actively going for which majors. This is required because different credentials have access
      to different information. It's annoying but there's no way around it, if we want to be able to access all the
      information we need to maintain the sites we do.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, the CAE auth will almost always be called first, to check if the user has CAE Center
      credentials. Then it will cascade to checking with main campus via the WMU auth. And if anything is found, it will
      finally cascade to the ADV auth to make sure all the auxiliary user information is up to date.
