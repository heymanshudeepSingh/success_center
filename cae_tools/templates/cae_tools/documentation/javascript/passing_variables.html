  <h2>Passing Variables</h2>

  <article id="reasoning" class="color">
    <h3>Reasoning for Needing to "Pass" Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Variables need to be "passed" from Python code to JavaScript, due to the nature of the two languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Django (and thus Python) code is server-side, as in it runs entirely on the production server. The server gets the
      user's request, responds accordingly (generally by making a template), then passes this response back to the user's
      local browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, JavaScript code is client-side, as in it runs entirely on the user's local machine and browser.
      Once the browser receives a response, it renders this response to the user. JavaScript can then begin running
      within the browser, and respond accordingly to user interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two processes are entirely separate. Thus, JavaScript code can only get variables explicitly passed to it,
      either from within the response template, from a websocket connection, or from a JSON request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, outside of websockets or JSON requests, JavaScript is unable to really pass data back to the server at
      all. This is why, to pass data, most sites will have the browser bypass JavaScript and instead make an entirely
      new page request.

    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>
      After much experimentation and various implementations, we now have a recommended way to pass variables from Python
      logic (variables in Django middleware/views/templates) to JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there's no "correct" way to pass variables, but this is the manner we've settled on for this project.
      If nothing else, having an "established" method means it's at least consistent between projects maintained at the
      CAE Center, and thus easier to maintain.

      <h4>Passing Middleware Variables</h4>
      <p>
        For passing <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:documentation_middleware' %}">Middleware</a> variables, to JavaScript, we
        have opted to do it in one single location, at the bottom of
        <span class="highlight primary">&lt;project_root&gt;/cae_home/templates/cae_home/base.html</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we have a script tag where we define a <span class="highlight info">window.django_middleware</span>
        JavaScript dictionary object, and pass in the corresponding middleware variables as key-value pairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saving it to the <span class="highlight info">window.django_middleware</span> gives it a sort of namespace,
        so it's easily identifiable in JavaScript code, and can't be accidentally overridden.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        It can then be accessed from any JavaScript file that extends CAE Home templates, via the following syntax:
      </p>
      <p class="highlight info">window.django_middleware.&lt;variable_key&gt;</p>

      <br>
      <div class="panel info">
        <div class="header">
          <p>Example:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="footer">
          <pre>
            &lt;script&gt;
            // Pass required template values in to JavaScript as variables.
            window.django_middleware = &#123;
              my_passed_var_1: "some_value",
              my_passed_var_2: "some_value_2",
            &#125;
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h4>Passing View/Template Variables</h4>
      <p>
        Passing view/template variables to JavaScript is handled extremely similar to middleware ones. The difference
        is that we save these variables to a <span class="highlight info">window.django_template</span> dictionary, to
        keep it obvious which variables were passed from which location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, this <span class="highlight info">window.django_template</span> dictionary is only defined in the
        corresponding template, that way the variable doesn't clutter up all pages served in all projects.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        This dictionary is then only accessible in JavaScript loaded from the given template, via syntax like:
      </p>
      <p class="highlight info">window.django_template.&lt;variable_key&gt;</p>
      <br>
      <div class="panel info">
        <div class="header">
          <p>Example:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="footer">
          <pre>
            &lt;script&gt;
            // Pass required template values in to JavaScript as variables.
            window.django_template = &#123;
              my_passed_var_1: "some_value",
              my_passed_var_2: "some_value_2",
            &#125;
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  </article>
