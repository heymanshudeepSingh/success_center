  <h2>Provided JavaScript Libraries & Logic</h2>
  <p>
    Workspace provides some JavaScript libraries by default. These are automatically loaded and available to all
    templates that extend logic from CAE Home.
  </p>

  <article id="third-party-libraries" class="color">
    <h3>Third Party Libraries</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>JQuery</b> - <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> is a library that adds a significant amount of
          general logic and helper functions to the base JavaScript language.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a lot of cases, JQuery accomplishes what JavaScript could already do, but in far fewer lines and much
          easier to maintain code. Plus, according to the documentation, it has minimal footprint, and is cross-browser
          compliant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>React</b> - <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> is a library that overhauls JavaScript to be much more
          dynamic and organized for large-scale pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that React is a pretty significant overhaul of JavaScript, on its own. To the point that it can act as a
          full, stand-alone web server. Workspace only uses it for front-end management, but there's still a bit of a
          learning curve to getting it working.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Flatpickr</b> - <a href="https://flatpickr.js.org/">Flatpickr</a> is a third-party, JavaScript-based
          datetime form widget. It's used for some of Workspace's
          <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:css_forms_custom_fields' %}">Custom Datetime Form Widgets</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Select2</b> - <a href="https://select2.org/">Select2</a> is a third-party, JQuery-based selectbox form
          widget. It's used for some of Workspace's
          <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:css_forms_custom_fields' %}">Custom Select Form Widgets</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <article id="custom-javascript-logic" class="color">
    <h3>Custom JavaScript Logic</h3>
    <p>
      CAE Workspace also provides a handful of custom JavaScript logic. This includes things like mobile handling,
      custom form widgets, custom interactive CSS elements, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of these are showcased in the <a href="{% url 'cae_tools:css_examples' %}">CSS Example</a> pages.
      The associated code is located at
      <span class="highlight primary">&lt;project_root&gt;/cae_home/static/cae_home/js/</span>.
