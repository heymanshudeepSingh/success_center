  <h2>Dev Passwords</h2>
  <p>
    When the project generates seeds, there is a "dev password" that is used for all seeded user accounts. This password
    is defined towards the bottom of the
    <a href="{% url 'dev:documentation_settings_local_environment' %}">Local Environment Settings</a> file, so
    that it can be changed locally on a per-machine basis.
  </p>
  <article class="color">
    <h3>Password Values</h3>
    <p>
      The default value for this password is <span class="highlight primary">temppass2</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is stored in locally in plaintext, if you change it, it's recommended to change it to something easy to
      remember that is not a normal password you use for any other account logins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If desired, it can be something really insecure if you want, such as a single character. It only affects your local
      development environment so there's really no harm in making it whatever you want.
    </p>
  </article>
  <p>
    To create a new user account that's generated via seeds, edit the file located at
    <span class="highlight primary">/cae_home/commands/seeders/user.py</span>. See the
    <a href="{% url 'dev:documentation_seeds_and_fixtures' %}">seeding</a> documentation for more.
