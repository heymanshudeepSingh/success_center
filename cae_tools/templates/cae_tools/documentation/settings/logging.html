  <h2>Project Logging</h2>
  <p>The workspace project has custom logging logic, which saves all console output to file.</p>
  <p>
    The default location for logs is <span class="highlight primary">/settings/local_env/logs/</span> and can be changed
    in the <a href="{% url 'dev:documentation_settings_local_environment' %}">Local Environment Settings</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This log file is effectively the same as logging in most CAE Center Python projects, but with a few extra filters
    and handlers for web serving.
  </p>
